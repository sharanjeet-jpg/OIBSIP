Welcome to Oasis Infobyte's repository for web development projects! This repository contains projects aimed at beginners to help them learn and develop foundational skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Descriptions

### Task 1: Landing Page Development

Create an impressive landing page for Oasis Infobyte using HTML and CSS. This project focuses on understanding basic HTML structure, CSS styling, layout design, and element positioning. Pay attention to details such as color palette, alignment, padding, and avoiding element overlap.

### Task 2: Personal Portfolio

Build a personal portfolio website showcasing your skills and projects using HTML and CSS. This project allows you to display a range of samples, skills, and your resume. Include an introduction image and contact information for a professional touch.

### Task 3: Temperature Converter
